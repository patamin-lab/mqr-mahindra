Current Sprint: Sprint 10
Current Branch: feature/pm-record-workflow-redesign (branched from main after M1-M6.5 merged)
Current Module: PM Record
Current Milestone: Workflow Redesign Phase 3 Complete — GPS, Maps & Location
Current Status: In Progress (Phase 3 of a multi-phase production UX redesign; Phases 4-5 not started)

M1-M6.5 (CRUD module, tests, CI, dependency audit, release review) are
merged into `main` (PR #2, merge commit `32c4e29`). Everything below this
line describes the NEW production UX redesign, built on top of that
merged foundation, not yet merged.

Architecture: Frozen
Documentation: Frozen
ADR: 7 Approved

Delivered (Complete):
- src/features/pm-record/ — types, Zod schemas wired into both API routes,
  validation helpers, PmRecordRepository interface, SupabasePmRecordRepository
  (full CRUD, soft delete, dealer scoping), PmRecordService, shared
  create/edit form component, fetch-by-id helper
- src/app/api/pm-records/ — GET (list), POST (create) — standardized
  { ok, data } / { ok, error: { code, message } } envelope
- src/app/api/pm-records/[id]/ — GET (detail), PUT (update), DELETE
  (soft delete) — PATCH removed (was an unused stub)
- src/app/(app)/pm-records/ — list page, create page (new/), detail page
  ([id]/), edit page ([id]/edit/), delete action (delete-button.tsx) — all
  session-gated, with loading/saving states and success/error toasts
- Automated tests (Vitest, introduced this module — no framework existed
  before): unit tests for PmRecordService and SupabasePmRecordRepository
  (service.test.ts, supabaseRepository.test.ts); API integration tests for
  every endpoint (route.test.ts at both route levels), mocking only the
  Repository layer
- Database Hardening & RLS Audit (read-only, no code changed): confirmed
  soft delete/audit-field logic is correct in code; confirmed UI never
  bypasses Service/Repository; found two live-schema defects (below)

Resolved in M6.1 (Supabase migration `align_pm_records_soft_delete_and_constraints`,
version 20260701130836, applied to live project `lhlzzxjayywqhqtjzfiu`):
- Live `pm_records` table now has `record_status` (`NOT NULL DEFAULT 'Active'`,
  check constraint `Active`/`Deleted`), `deleted_by`, `deleted_at` — matching
  every repository method's assumption
- Live `pm_records.scheduled_date` is now nullable, matching the app's
  end-to-end optional treatment
- Added indexes on `dealer_id`, `branch_id`, `technician_id`, `record_status`
  (previously only the PK was indexed)
- Table had 0 rows at migration time — purely additive/constraint-relaxing,
  no data migration was needed, no destructive changes made

Resolved in M6.2 (Supabase migration `harden_pm_records_rls_soft_delete_scoping`,
version 20260701131859, applied to live project `lhlzzxjayywqhqtjzfiu`):
- `pm_records_anon_upd` now requires `record_status = 'Active'` to select a
  row for update (was unconditional `true`) — an already-soft-deleted row
  can no longer be touched by any raw update, independent of application
  code; `WITH CHECK (true)` is explicit so the Active→Deleted transition
  itself still succeeds
- `pm_records_anon_ins` now requires the inserted row's `record_status` to
  be `'Active'` (was unconditional `true`)
- `pm_records_anon_sel` now requires `record_status = 'Active'` to be
  visible at all (was unconditional `true`) — a soft-deleted row is now
  invisible even to a raw anon-key API call; zero app behavior change
  since `getById()`/`list()` already treated a Deleted row as "not found"
- Confirmed (no change needed): no DELETE policy exists on `pm_records` —
  hard delete via the anon key was already impossible before this
  milestone, Postgres RLS defaults to deny with no matching policy

Still-open, unresolved (structural, not fixed by M6.2 — requires a code
change explicitly out of a migration-only milestone's scope):
- **No RLS-enforced dealer/branch isolation exists, and none can be added
  without a code change.** This app has no Supabase Auth and sets no
  per-request Postgres session variable — every request reaches Postgres
  through one shared `anon` role with zero identity signal, so a
  dealer-scoped RLS policy has nothing to filter on. Real isolation
  requires either adopting Supabase Auth with custom claims or having the
  app `set_config()` a per-request session variable — both are future,
  separately-authorized architecture decisions, not migration work.
  Dealer/branch/actor-identity scoping remains 100% application-layer
  (`PmRecordService` + route handlers), matching every other table in
  this project (`applyScope()` in `lib/db.ts`).
- Four unused legacy columns (`model`, `delivery_date`, `customer_name`,
  `customer_phone`) remain on `pm_records`, harmless but not part of
  `PmRecord`'s type — schema-cleanliness cleanup, not a defect

Resolved in M6.3 (repo-wide, not PM-Record-specific):
- Added `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — runs on every `push`/`pull_request`:
  `npm ci` → `tsc --noEmit` → `npm run lint` → `npm run build` →
  `npm test`, Node 20, npm dependency caching via `actions/setup-node`.
  This repository previously had no CI at all (`docs/DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md`
  §5/§6 said so explicitly; now corrected).
- Verified `next build` needs no environment variables in CI: every
  `process.env.*` read in `src/` is inside a function body (evaluated at
  request time) or has a hardcoded fallback, not evaluated at build/import
  time — confirmed by grep, not assumed.

Resolved in M6.4 (repo-wide, not PM-Record-specific — package-lock.json
only, no package.json range changes, since all 3 were already permitted
by the existing caret ranges):
- `@supabase/supabase-js` 2.108.2 → 2.110.0 (safe minor update)
- `autoprefixer` 10.5.0 → 10.5.2 (safe patch update)
- `resend` 6.14.0 → 6.16.0 (safe minor update)

Documented only, NOT applied (all require a breaking major-version bump —
out of this milestone's scope per its own "document only" instruction):
- **7 npm audit findings (4 High, 3 Medium), all fixable only via
  `npm audit fix --force`:**
  - High: `next` (installed 14.2.35) — multiple CVEs (DoS via Image
    Optimizer/Server Components, HTTP request smuggling in rewrites,
    middleware cache poisoning/bypass, XSS via CSP nonces/beforeInteractive
    scripts) — fix requires `next@16.2.9` (two major versions up)
  - High: `glob` (transitive, via `@next/eslint-plugin-next` →
    `eslint-config-next`) — CLI command injection — devDependency-only
    (lint tooling, never shipped to the running app); fix tied to the same
    `next`/`eslint-config-next` v16 upgrade
  - Medium: `postcss` (bundled inside `next`'s own `node_modules`) — XSS
    via unescaped `</style>` — same v16 upgrade chain
  - Medium: `uuid` (transitive, via `exceljs`) — missing buffer bounds
    check — fix tied to an `exceljs` major-version change
  - **Major-version upgrades available, not applied** (would require
    dedicated migration/testing effort, all high-blast-radius since they
    touch the framework, UI runtime, or auth): `next` 14→16, `react`/
    `react-dom` 18→19, `eslint` 8→10, `eslint-config-next` 14→16,
    `jose` 5→6 (session signing — auth-critical), `typescript` 5→6,
    `tailwindcss` 3→4 (config-format breaking), `zod` 3→4 (used directly
    in PM Record's `schemas.ts`), `@types/node` 20→26, `@types/react`
    18→19, `@types/react-dom` 18→19, `react-leaflet` 4→5, `recharts` 2→3
  - **Informational**: `npm install` flags `unrs-resolver@1.12.2` (a
    transitive devDependency of `eslint-config-next`, lint-tooling only,
    never shipped) as having an unreviewed install script under npm's
    `allow-scripts` feature. Not a known vulnerability (no CVE) — noted
    for manual review (`npm approve-scripts`), not auto-approved here.
  - No deprecated-package warnings surfaced from a fresh `npm install`.

Fixed in M6.5 (one genuine release blocker found during the final review,
fixed under that milestone's narrow "fix only if a genuine blocker exists"
allowance):
- `src/features/pm-record/fetchPmRecord.ts` built its server-to-server
  fetch URL as `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL ?? 'http://localhost:3000'`.
  `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` is not set anywhere in this deployment (grepped
  the whole `src/` tree and root `CLAUDE.md`'s environment-variables
  section — it appears nowhere else and isn't documented), so in
  production this would have silently targeted `http://localhost:3000`
  from inside a Vercel serverless function — unreachable, breaking the PM
  Record **detail and edit pages** (both call `fetchPmRecord()`). Fixed
  by falling through to Vercel's automatically-provided `VERCEL_URL` env
  var (no manual configuration needed) before ever defaulting to
  localhost. One file, one function, no architecture change.

Final M6.5 review: READY FOR MERGE. No other genuine release blocker was
found across dependency direction, repository/service abstraction, API/
response contracts, domain model, validation, authorization, persistence,
soft delete, audit fields, testing, documentation, CI, RLS, migration
alignment, security, or performance.

========================================================
Workflow Redesign — Production UX (KTV reference)
========================================================

Phase 1 (complete, commit `2e3f1cc`): Master Data Foundation
- New `pm_intervals` master table + `/admin/pm-intervals` CRUD page
  (mirrors the existing `problem_codes` admin pattern exactly)
- `vehicles.engine_number`, `vehicles.branch_id` (FK to `branches`) added
  (Tractor Master gets a real home-branch attribute + engine number)

Phase 2 (complete, this commit): Search-First Workflow
- Replaced `/pm-records/new` (was a generic create form) with a search-first
  flow: search Tractor Master (Dealer→Branch cascade, Serial autocomplete
  3+ chars, Customer Name/Phone via PM history join) → Recent Vehicles
  (last 5, localStorage, no new table) → select → auto-fill (dealer/branch/
  serial/engine number/model/retail date; customer name/phone always
  entered fresh, never auto-filled) → enter hour meter/PM interval/
  technician/notes → upload 3 required photos (reuses the existing
  `/api/upload` + Google Drive `_pending`→relocate pattern from QIR,
  unmodified) → pre-save duplicate check (same tractor+interval+date,
  warn-and-continue, never a hard block) → save.
- Business number `PM-[DealerCode]-[Year]-[Running]` generated server-side
  in `SupabasePmRecordRepository.create()`, reusing the existing `job_seq`
  table / `next_job_seq()` RPC that QIR's `job_id` already uses (QIR calls
  it with a global sentinel dealer_id; PM Record calls it with the real
  dealer code, so each dealer gets its own per-year sequence for free —
  zero new migration needed for this part).
- New `pm_records` columns (live migration applied): `engine_number`,
  `hour_meter`, `pm_interval_id` (FK), `pm_number` (unique),
  `meter_photo_url`/`nameplate_photo_url`/`report_photo_url`.
  `customer_name`/`customer_phone`/`model`/`delivery_date` already existed
  on the live table since Sprint 10.1 but were never wired into the
  `PmRecord` TypeScript type until now — no migration needed for those four.
- Detail/list pages updated to show PM number (not the raw UUID — "Do NOT
  expose UUID" per spec) plus the new fields/photos.
- 45/45 tests passing (was 39 - added `findDuplicate` coverage plus fixed
  fixtures for the expanded `PmRecord` shape).

Phase 3 (complete, this commit): GPS, Maps & Location Experience
- Reused the existing Leaflet + Esri World Imagery (satellite) + Nominatim
  stack already used by the QIR report form's location picker, rather than
  introducing real Google Maps JS API (would have required a brand-new
  paid dependency, a new Google Cloud API key, and billing enabled on
  Google's side, none of which exists today) - confirmed with the user
  before proceeding. Esri World Imagery is already satellite tiles, so
  "default satellite layer, not road map" was already true beforehand.
- New reusable components under `src/components/shared/gps/` (PM-Record-
  agnostic, ready for any future module): `GpsMapView` (draggable-marker
  map, or read-only for a detail page), `GpsLocationPicker` (search +
  current-location + map + reverse-geocode display), `reverseGeocode.ts`
  (Nominatim reverse/forward geocoding), `exif.ts` (EXIF GPS reading via
  the new `exifr` dependency - a small, justified, client-only addition;
  hand-rolling binary EXIF/TIFF parsing would have been far more
  error-prone for this one feature).
- Location search accepts a place name, a pasted "lat,lng" pair, or a
  Google Maps URL (parsed directly, no geocoding round-trip) - all three
  forms the spec asked for.
- GPS accuracy displayed (±N m); a warning shows above 30m but never
  blocks Save, since GPS remains fully optional throughout.
- EXIF photo-GPS: uploading any of the 3 required photos checks for
  embedded GPS and offers "use photo location" vs. "keep current" -
  technician chooses, never applied silently.
- New `pm_records` columns (live migration applied): `latitude`,
  `longitude`, `gps_accuracy`, `google_maps_url` - all nullable, no
  address components stored (reverse-geocoded village/subdistrict/
  district/province are display-only, per spec, never persisted).
- Detail page now shows a read-only satellite map, coordinates, accuracy,
  and an "Open Google Maps" button when a location was captured.
- 47/47 tests passing (was 45).

Not started (Phases 4-5, per the agreed phasing):
- Phase 4: History page (filters) + CSV/Individual PDF/Summary PDF/Bulk
  PDF export + image ZIP download + the elaborate `PM/YYYY/MM/PM-number/`
  Drive folder nesting / photo-upload polish (compression, drag & drop,
  progress bar) not yet done in Phase 2/3
- Phase 5: Dashboard (PM Today/This Month/Upcoming/Overdue, by Dealer/
  Branch, trend, recent PM)

Next Milestone: Phase 4 (History + Export), pending explicit direction
Candidate next tasks (unscheduled, pending explicit direction):
- Phase 4/5 above
- A dedicated Next.js 14→16 (+ React 18→19) upgrade milestone, given 4 of
  7 M6.4 audit findings require it — the single biggest remaining risk item
- A future ADR decision on Supabase Auth (or per-request session
  variables) if real RLS-enforced dealer/branch isolation is ever required
- Drop the four now-genuinely-unused legacy columns on `pm_records`
  (`model`/`delivery_date` are now used as snapshot fields, so only
  cleanup candidates remain if any are found to still be truly dead)
- Extend automated test coverage to other modules (only PM Record has
  tests today)

Current Blockers:
None. This redesign branch has not been merged to `main` yet — pending
explicit direction on when/whether to open that PR (deliberately separate
from the M1-M6.5 merge, since this is new, unreviewed, unreleased work).

Legacy Naming (tracked, not yet renamed — pending ADR):
- SESSION_COOKIE = 'mqr_session' (lib/auth.ts)
- STORAGE_BUCKET = 'mqr-files' (lib/supabase.ts)
- MqrRecord interface (lib/types.ts)
- Sidebar display name 'Market Quality Report' (sidebar.tsx)
